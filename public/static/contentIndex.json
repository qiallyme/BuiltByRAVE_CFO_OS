Loud. Aggressive. Disrespectful.\nI didn’t shrink. I didn’t escalate.\nI took her to a private room and explained—with facts, calm, and leadership—why she had no right to speak to my team that way.\nShe had:\n\nMisread the situation\nIgnored critical data\nDemanded unnecessary action\n\nThe Client:\n\nWas Racist and sexist\nRequested illegal acts.\n\nI shut it down.

Don’t Reprimand Me.\nI’m not here to be punished for being human.\nYou want to reprimand someone for running late? Hire an intern.\nYou want to build something game-changing with someone who cares more than anyone else ever will? That’s me.\nJust give me this:\n\n\nBe honest, not passive-aggressive\n\n\nBe patient, not punitive\n\n\nCommunicate like a grown-ass leader\n\n\nTrust the delivery, even when the rhythm’s not traditional\n\n\n\nYou’ll Get My Best.
