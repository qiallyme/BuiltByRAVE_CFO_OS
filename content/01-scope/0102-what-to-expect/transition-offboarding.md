# 💼 Transition & Offboarding

When our contract ends, I’ll support a clean exit. That includes:

- Status reports on all deliverables  
- Optional offboarding assistance for up to 3 months  
- Documentation handoff (unless IP rights are retained)  
- Training or transition planning for your new service provider (if applicable)

Deliverables may be restricted if payments are past due, per contract terms.
