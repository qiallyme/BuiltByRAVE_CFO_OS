# 📊 Real-Time Command Center

You’ll always know what’s working and what needs attention.

I build:
- Custom dashboards for revenue, ops, and performance
- Live KPI trackers
- “Bottleneck alerts” to catch drops in productivity
- Strategic insight boards for decision-making

If you’ve been guessing—this is the end of that era.
