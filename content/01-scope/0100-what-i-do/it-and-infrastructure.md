I set up systems that don’t crash. From automation to cybersecurity, I’ll cover your digital ass until it’s time to bring in dedicated techs. I don’t just fix problems—I _design out_ future ones.

# 🖥️ IT & Infrastructure

I set up systems that **don’t crash**—and that grow with you.

What I handle:
- Internal systems (file storage, software, logins, security)
- Communication stack (email, chat, scheduling)
- Tech vendor management (hosting, cloud, devices)
- Future scaling (server, cloud, and AI readiness)

Temporary CTO? That’s me. Until we hire one permanently, I run the tech behind the curtain.
