I am #not-on-call 24/7. I don’t do random emergency texts or out of pocket messages unless we’ve scoped them.

**My #availability is #structured** so I can protect my energy, deliver #high-impact work, and show up sharp.

You get focused #executive support—not a #help-desk.

We set clear communication windows—and I always show up during them. Respect my time, and I’ll multiply yours.
