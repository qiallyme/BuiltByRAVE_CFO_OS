❌ I’m Not a CPA **(And You Don’t Need One)**

I’m an accountant—strategic, practical, and experienced AF.

Unless you're a nonprofit, government contractor, or under audit, you don’t need a $150/hr CPA.

You need someone who understands your cash flow, files clean returns, and builds systems you can scale.

That’s me.
