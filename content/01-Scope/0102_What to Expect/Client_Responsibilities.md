# ðŸ“ˆ Client Responsibilities

To keep our momentum strong, I ask that you:

- Provide timely and accurate documentation  
- Respond to messages within 48 business hours  
- Submit receipts/forms by the 5th of each month (if applicable)  
- Use agreed-upon tools and platforms for communication  
- Let me know about any big changes in your business

Delays or missed deliverables caused by inaction may result in rescheduling or added fees.  
I respect your timeâ€”please respect mine.
