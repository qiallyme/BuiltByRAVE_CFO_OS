# ðŸ¤– AI + Automation Everywhere

If it can be automated, it will be.

My approach:
- No-code / low-code automations (Zapier, Make.com, Airtable, etc.)
- Internal workflow automation (form processing, email triggers, file renaming)
- External client experience automation (CRM, proposals, onboarding)
- Embedded GPT, AI tools, and intelligent routing

You donâ€™t need more assistants. You need smarter systems.
