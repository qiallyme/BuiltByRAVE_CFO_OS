I step in as your part-time **COO/CFO/CTO**â€”the person who doesnâ€™t just fix whatâ€™s broken, but builds whatâ€™s _next_. You get executive clarity, without executive overhead.

# ðŸ‘‘ Fractional C-Suite Partner

I operate as your temporary-but-mighty **COO / CFO / CTO hybrid**. You get the strategic firepower of an executive teamâ€”without the six-figure salaries.

What this means:
- I help lead your business like an owner, not an outsider.
- I make operational calls that save money, grow profit, and remove friction.
- I build, manage, or upgrade the systems your team uses daily.

I donâ€™t just advise. I get in, fix it, build it, and teach your team to run it.
