# ðŸ§¾ Accounting & Tax, Done Right

I handle the messy stuff most founders avoid.

Includes:
- Bookkeeping, reconciliations, chart of accounts cleanup
- Tax filing for sole props, LLCs, S-corps, and partnerships
- Strategic tax planning (quarterly & annual)
- Cash flow forecasting

Iâ€™m not a CPAâ€”but I do bring real-world tax strategy and bookkeeping support that makes you audit-resistant and future-ready.
