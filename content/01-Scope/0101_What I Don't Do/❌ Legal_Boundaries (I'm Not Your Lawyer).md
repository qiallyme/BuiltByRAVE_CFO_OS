title: Legal Boundaries (I'm Not Your Lawyer)
---
Yes—I’ve studied contract law, business law, employment law. I've worked in HR. I’ve reviewed and drafted countless contracts.

But let’s be clear:

> **I do NOT practice law. I am not a licensed attorney.**

**What I *can* do:**
- Review your contracts with a strategic, operational lens  
- Help you *understand* what you're signing  
- Draft templates or mockups based on standard practices  
- Offer insights from real-world HR and finance experience

**What I *won’t* do:**
- Guarantee legal outcomes  
- Provide legal opinions  
- Replace a licensed attorney

If you want something **legally binding**, talk to an attorney. If you want something *clear, usable, and smart*—I got you.
