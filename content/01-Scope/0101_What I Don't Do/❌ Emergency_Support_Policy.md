Emergencies are rare, not regular.

I don’t respond to last-minute panics unless we’ve planned for them. If you need urgent, off-hours support, let’s scope that as a paid add-on or create an escalation protocol.

My brain works best when it’s not on red alert 24/7.

Last minute request equals last minute pay $99 flat rate plus hourly work.
