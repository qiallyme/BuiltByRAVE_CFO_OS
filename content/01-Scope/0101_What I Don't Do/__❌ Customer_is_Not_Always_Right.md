title: Customer is Not Always Right

# ❌ The Customer is Not Always Right

Yeah, yeah, it *sounds* good in retail. But in real business? That phrase needs a full-blown reality check.

People say “the customer is always right,” but let’s break that down:

> **“The customer determines what they’re willing to pay for.”**

That part is true. But that doesn’t make them *objectively correct*.  
It doesn’t mean I compromise my ethics.  
It doesn’t mean I tolerate abuse, bigotry, or bulldozing.  
And it damn sure doesn’t mean I’ll bend the law—or break myself—for a smile and a paycheck.

## 👊 I’m Not Here to Please You. I’m Here to Protect You.

I will fight for your business like it’s my own.

I will work late. I will solve impossible problems. I will jump into the fire when others run.

But I don’t coddle dysfunction.
I don’t stroke egos.
And I don’t say “yes” when the answer should be “*not like that*.”

> **If I challenge you, it’s not to be difficult—it’s because I *care enough not to let you fail quietly*.**

## 🧠 I’m a Partner, Not a Lackey

I’m part of your **leadership team**—not your assistant, your punching bag, or your emotional sponge.

You bring me in to:
- Stop fires before they start  
- Protect your people and your reputation  
- Push back on dangerous decisions  
- Build structures that *last longer than us both*

You get a strategic partner, not a “yes person.”

## 🗣️ Real Talk: A Client Story

One time, the CEO of a major logistics firm came in *yelling* at my staff. Loud. Aggressive. Disrespectful.

I didn’t shrink. I didn’t escalate.  
I took her to a private room and explained—with facts, calm, and leadership—**why she had no right to speak to my team that way**.

She had:
- Misread the situation  
- Ignored critical data  
- Demanded unnecessary action  

The Client:
- Was Racist and sexist
- Requested illegal acts.

I shut it down. With backbone and receipts.

And you know what? She backed down.  
She **thanked me** for the clarity.  
Then we made the decision to part ways with the client—because we don’t partner with clients who *profit from harm*.

## 🛡️ I’ll Ride for You — If You Ride for Me

If you treat me with respect, honor my role, and give me room to breathe when I need it?

I will go to war for you.

I will guard your business like a vault.  
I will protect your vision like it’s my own.  
I will walk through hell *with* you—just don’t throw me in it.

All I ask is this:
- Treat me like a human, not a machine  
- Respect my boundaries like I respect yours  
- Give me grace when I’m quiet (that’s when I’m building)

## ♿ My Disabilities Don’t Make Me Less. They Make Me Real.

You should know: I live with invisible disabilities.  
**ADHD. Insomnia. Chronic pain. Neurodivergence. Trauma wiring.**

I might pause to reset—but I never give up.  
I work differently, not less.  
And when I *am* on? I’m unstoppable.

Let’s talk facts.

Yes—I live with invisible disabilities.  
Some days I’m unstoppable.  
Some days I’m running on fumes.

What does that mean for _your_ business?

It means:  
Yeah, I might miss a scheduled call sometimes.  
I might be late to a meeting.  
I might need a day to regroup, reset, or pause the pace.

But what you get in return? **More than most “perfectly on time” people could ever give you.**

Because when I _am_ on—I’m electric.  
I go deep. I deliver fast. I make the impossible happen.

I make up for missed calls with:

- Out-of-scope deliverables I don’t charge for
    
- Late-night rebuilds of broken workflows
    
- Client-saving automation I built on my “day off”
    
- Loyalty most people talk about—but don’t live

**Don’t Abuse It. Don’t Reprimand Me.**

I’m not here to be punished for being human.

You want to reprimand someone for running late? Hire an intern.  
You want to build something game-changing with someone who cares more than anyone else ever will? That’s me.

Just give me this:

- Be honest, not passive-aggressive
    
- Be patient, not punitive
    
- Communicate like a grown-ass leader
    
- Trust the delivery, even when the rhythm’s not traditional

**You’ll Get My Best. And It’ll Be Better Than 9-to-5.**

I may not fit the corporate mold.  
But I don’t miss deadlines that matter.  
I don’t half-ass the work.  
And I sure as hell don’t clock out when you need me most.

What I bring is _beyond schedule_.  
What I build is _beyond safe_.  
What I offer is _rare_—and worth protecting.

If you can hold space for how I work,  
I will build you something better than anything you could’ve bought off the shelf.

This is partnership, not perfection.  
This is real life.  
And I show up for it—with everything I’ve got.

## ✅ Final Word

If you’re hiring me just to nod and execute—we’ll clash.

But if you’re looking for a partner who:
- Sees what others miss  
- Fights for what’s right  
- Brings their whole self to the table

Then you’re in the right vault.

**The customer isn’t always right. But the right client? Knows when to listen.**

Let’s build something real.
