## What This Is
This is your **Virtual CFO Operating System** — your entire financial strategy, KPIs, growth roadmap, and agreements in one place. Think of it as your *CFO in an app*.

- Everything is here: strategy, metrics, FAQs, and your signed redline.
- If you don’t see daily updates, that’s normal — strategy is long‑term and silent work matters.
- This app is yours for the full term of our agreement (12 months minimum).

## How to Use It
1. **Start Here**: Read the Scope and KPIs — that’s what we’re building toward.  
2. **Check Roadmap**: See milestones at 3, 6, and 12 months.  
3. **Review FAQs**: Answers to “why are we paying if you’re quiet?” and more.  
4. **Redline Agreement**: PDF inside `06-Redline_Agreement` — sign or reference anytime.  
5. **Updates**: If synced, you’ll see updates automatically. If portable, I’ll send new builds as needed.
